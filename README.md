# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection

Developed and evaluated multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVC) on an imbalanced real-world transaction dataset to identify fraudulent activities.
Executed end-to-end data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis, discovering key fraud patterns related to transaction type, amount, and balance differences.
Achieved a high fraud detection performance with XGBoost (ROC-AUC: 0.99) and improved recall for rare fraud cases, enabling early detection of unseen fraudulent behavior while minimizing false positives.
